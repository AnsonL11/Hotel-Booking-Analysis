# Deployment statragies
  1. Download the dataset (CSV) manually and upload it into Jupyter. Click:[File dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
  2. Perform data cleaning and data transforming, to remove NaN columns and rows and fixing incomplete data within dataset.

# Where do the guests come from?

![map](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Hotel-Booking-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs/Guest%20country%20map.png)
From the map above shows the most of the guests are come from Europe countries and Portugal, UK and France have the highest numbers of guests are statying in resort and city hotels. This maybe because the hotels are located in Europe.

# Price for a room per night.

Figure above to see the average price per room, depending on its type and the standard deviation.

# How does the price per night vary over the year?
![line](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Hotel-Booking-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs/Room%20price.png)

It can be seen that the price are much more higher in the Resort hotel compare to City hotel during the summer season. However, during spring and autumn the price of city hotel is most expensive.

# Distribution of Nights Spent at Hotels by Market Segment and Hotel Type
![chart](https://github.com/AnsonL11/Hotel-Booking-Analysis/blob/main/Graphs/Night%20spent.png)

It clearly shows in the distribution that most of the people do not seem to prefer to stay at the hotel for more than 1 week. However, it seems normal to stay in resort hotels for up to 12-13 days. It is obvious shows that when people go to resort hotels, they prefer to stay longer.

# Analysing Preference of Guests, what they basically Prefer?

The donut pie above is the meal categories. There is a big difference in the Bed&Breakfast category and the others. Almost 80% of bookings reserved for Bed&Breakfast.

# Status of hotel demand per month

City hotel has higher demand during spring and autumn, and the prices are highest as well.
When the prices are highest from June to September, the demand for Resort hotel are slighty go down.Â¶
Resort hotel and City hotel have the lower demanded during winter.

Bar chart above indicated that most of the people prefer to stay for around 3 to 4 nights in city hotel.

# Hotel bookings by market segment
