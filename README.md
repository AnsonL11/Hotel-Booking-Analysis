# Deployment statragies
  1. Download the dataset (CSV) manually and upload it into Jupyter. Click:[File dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
  2. Perform data cleaning and data transforming, to remove NaN columns and rows and fixing incomplete data within dataset.

Figure above to see the average price per room, depending on its type and the standard deviation.

It can be seen that the price are much more higher in the Resort hotel compare to City hotel during the summer season. However, during spring and autumn the price of city hotel is most expensive.
